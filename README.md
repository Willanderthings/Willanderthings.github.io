## Welcome to Willanderthings
Home to everything ''me.''

as a big tv show enthusiast, I've come across several gems which I'd like to share. I'm quite picky with the things I watch, and I usually drop a lot of them if I am begin to become uninterested midway through, so rest assured that the following are absolute masterpieces in their own right. Now then, here are just a few of my favorites that I'll be featuring for now, and a short sypnosis of each one. 

## 1. Breaking Bad 
''Set in Albuquerque, New Mexico, between 2008 and 2010, Breaking Bad follows Walter White, a meek high school chemistry teacher who transforms into a ruthless player in the local methamphetamine drug trade, driven by a desire to financially provide for his family after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.''

A classic, and hands down the best show I've ever watched. It may come across to most as very blunt and dark, but needless to say that it is deserving of the massive ammounts of fame and recognition it has gotten throughout the years. A masterful and excellent cast, and even grander writing and story telling. Definitely not for the faint of heart, but truly the best among the best. An absolute masterpiece.  


## 2. Better Call Saul
''Better Call Saul follows the transformation of Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), a former con artist who is trying to become a respectable lawyer, into the personality of the flamboyant criminal lawyer Saul Goodman (a play on the phrase "[it]'s all good, man!"), over the six-year period prior to the events of Breaking Bad''

As a prequel to Breaking Bad, it can be rest assured that it is just as good. It taps into the true nature of human impulse and it's effects on one's life and relationships, the transformation of a man who was brought down to his lowest, all with that classic Breaking Bad feel. It is truly deserving of it's title as a prequel. Once agian, an amazing cast, even greater writing. The absolute best. 


## 3. Parks and Recreation 
''Leslie Knope, a mid-level bureaucrat in an Indiana Parks and Recreation Department, hopes to beautify her town (and boost her own career) by helping local nurse Ann Perkins turn an abandoned construction site into a community park. However, what should be a fairly simple project is stymied at every turn by oafish bureaucrats, selfish neighbors, governmental red tape, and a myriad of other challenges. Leslie's colleague Tom Haverford, who delights in exploiting his position for personal gain, is as likely to undermine her efforts as to help her, while her boss, Ron Swanson, is adamantly opposed to government in any form, even though he's a bureaucrat.''

A comedic sitcom that is the best at what it does. I have honestly never laughed harder at a show before-- like the other two in this list, the cast are perfect down to every bit, and this show's sense of humor hits all the right spots in order to truly make it an enjoyable experience, whilst also deeply and expertly developing the cast and their relationships, a grand reminder that even though it is a comedy, these are still characters-- human beings who feel things, and are just as layered and complex as a real person. Absolutely the greatest. 

And that should be all. Hope anyone who visits this gives any of these a try, I firmly assure you that you won't regret it. And in the off chance that you do-- atleast now you've seen it for yourself.
